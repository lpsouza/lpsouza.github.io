Fazia tempo que andei atras disto!!! Segue abaixo o poema tema de Crisis Core (Final Fantasy VII):

> ### LOVELESS ( POEM )
>
> **Loveless - Prologue**
>
> When the war of the beasts brings about the world’s end  
> The goddess descends from the sky
>
> Wings of light and dark spread afar  
> She guides us to bliss, her gift everlasting
>
> **Loveless - Act I**
>
> Infinite in mystery is the gift of the goddess  
> We seek it thus, and take it to the sky  
> Ripples form on the water’s surface  
> The wandering soul knows no rest
>
> **Loveless - Act II**
>
> There is no hate, only joy  
> For you are beloved by the goddess  
> Hero of the dawn, Healer of worlds
>
> Dreams of the morrow hath the shattered soul  
> Pride is lost  
> Wings stripped away, the end is nigh
>
> **Loveless - Act III**
>
> My friend, do you fly away now?  
> To a world that abhors you and I?  
> All that awaits you is a somber morrow  
> No matter where the winds may blow
>
> My friend, your desire  
> Is the bringer of life, the gift of the goddess
>
> Even if the morrow is barren of promises  
> Nothing shall forestall my return
>
> **Loveless - Act IV**
>
> My friend, the fates are cruel  
> There are no dreams, no honor remains  
> The arrow has left the bow of the goddess
>
> My soul, corrupted by vengeance  
> Hath endured torment, to find the end of the journey  
> In my own salvation  
> And your eternal slumber
>
> Legend shall speak  
> Of sacrifice at world’s end  
> The wind sails over the water’s surface  
> Quietly, but surely
>
> **Loveless - Act V** _(Made by Genesis)_
>
> Even if the morrow is barren of promises  
> Nothing shall forestall my return  
> To become the dew that quenches the land  
> To spare the sands, the seas, the skies  
> I offer thee this silent sacrifice
>
> ### LOVELESS ( INTERPRETED )
>
> **Loveless - Prologue**
>
> When the war of the beasts brings about the world’s end  
> The goddess descends from the sky
>
> Wings of light and dark spread afar  
> She guides us to bliss, her gift everlasting
>
> **Loveless - Act I**
>
> The Infinite mystery  
> The gift of the goddess is what the three men seek  
> But their fates are scattered by war
>
> One becomes a hero, one wanders the land  
> And the last is taken prisoner
>
> But the three are still bound by a solemn oath  
> To seek the answer together, once again
>
> **Loveless - Act II**
>
> Though the prisoner escapes, he is gravely wounded  
> His life is saved, however  
> By a woman of the opposing nation
>
> He begins a life of seclusion with her  
> Which seems to hold the promise of eternal bliss
>
> But as happiness grows, so does guilt  
> Of not fulfilling the oath to his friends
>
> **Loveless - Act III**
>
> As the war sends the world hurling towards destruction  
> The prisoner departs with his newfound love  
> And embarks on a new journey
>
> He is guided by hope that the gift will bring bliss  
> And the oath that he swore to his friends
>
> Though no oath is shared between the lovers  
> In their hearts they know they will meet again
