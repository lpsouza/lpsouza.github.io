# Frontend Team Context

## Domain
Focus on the visual presentation and user interaction (via CSS) of the website.

## Key Responsibilities
1.  Creating/Updating Jekyll layouts (`_layouts`).
2.  Creating reusable components (`_includes`).
3.  Styling pages (`assets/css` or `_sass`).
4.  Ensuring responsive design across devices.

## Directives
- Prefer CSS-only solutions for interactivity (e.g., hover effects, CSS Grid/Flexbox for alignment).
- Keep CSS organized. If using SASS, follow the 7-1 pattern if applicable, or keep it simple for smaller projects.
- Validate HTML structure to ensure it renders correctly on GitHub Pages.
