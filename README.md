# My Website :-)

This repository contains the files of my humble website!

My website was originally created with Wordpress and i have a hard work to migrate to Jekyll!

## Work in progress

- [X] Export all content to Jekyll files.
- [X] Choose a simple but cool theme.
- [X] Translate all features from chosen theme to Brazilian Portuguese (my native language).
- [ ] Review all posts: Checking spelling.
- [ ] Review all posts: Removing Wordpress plugins code that no longer exist.
- [ ] Review all posts: Removing excessive use of HTML on Markdown.
- [ ] Organize folders structure from Wordpress exports to my improved structure.
